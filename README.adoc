This project produces the Antora UI bundle used by the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site[bonita-documentation-site]
repository to build the Bonita documentation website. +
It is based on the https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default[Antora Default UI].

ðŸ“£ Want to see the them in action? Let's have a look at

- the https://bonitasoft.github.io/bonita-documentation-theme/[theme preview environment]
- the https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/[Bonita documentation production site]

To report a Bug or submit a Feature Request, go to the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site/issues/[bonita-documentation-site issues].

== Prerequisites

The project requires Node 16, for nvm user, run `nvm use`.

For more details, see the https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/prerequisites/[prerequisites].


== Usage

This repository produces a zip archive _ui-bundle.zip_.
This archive is meant to be used by Antora, it is referenced in the main Antora https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site/blob/master/antora-playbook.yml[configuration file]. +
The process to release a new version of the theme is fully automated with github actions.

[TIP]
====
Simple flow to 'release' a new version of the theme (i.e. use a new version of the UI bundle in the doc site):

- Go in the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-theme/actions[Github Actions] section +
- Select "Start release process" workflow and run the workflow
====
This process will:

- Create a new tag
- Generate the theme bundle (_ui-bundle.zip_), and rename it with the release version
- Create a new release and attach the theme bundle as a release asset
- Send a Repository Dispatch event to the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site[bonita-documentation-site] repository

When this event is received, a new Pull Request is created in the https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-documentation-site[bonita-documentation-site] repository, with an updated theme bundle URL.

== Development

A static or live preview of the theme is available, run `npm run dev`. For more details, see the https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/build-preview-ui/[build-preview-ui] documentation.

To build the bundle to be used in the Antora playbook, run `npm run bundle`.

=== Change some colors in the UI

If you are only here to update some colors in the UI, it should be easy. +
All used colors are defined in _src/stylesheets/globals.var.scss_ +
At the beginning of the file, you will find the light colors and at the bottom of the file the dark colors. +
If you need to add a new color in the color set, then you have to:

- Create a variable `--color-XXX` in the light color set
- Create a variable `--color-XXX` in the dark color set
- Use this new color by using `var(--color-XXX)` in some css classes

[CAUTION]
====
If you simply update an existing color, your change will probably impact different elements of the UI. +
Make sure that the whole UI is OK before submitting your change, in both light and dark !
====

=== Perform some structural changes in the UI

This UI bundle is based on the Antora default UI. It uses gulp, handlebars and sass. +
You can find the detailed documentation on the UI bundle https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/[here].


=== Integrating changes from Antora UI Default

You can find the original code in the `antora-ui-default` branch of this repository or at https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default[GitLab].

This branch contains all improvements and bug fixes available in the `Antora UI Default` project that can be reintegrated in `bonita-documentation-theme`.

==== Updating the `antora-ui-default` branch

Add the GitLab repository as remote of your local repository

  $ git remote add antora-ui-default https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default.git

Update the `antora-ui-default` branch to reference the latest commits of the `master` branch of the `Antora Default UI` repository

  $ git reset --hard antora-ui-default/master

Push the changes to GitHub (assuming that `origin` is the alias for the GitHub repository)

  $ git push origin antora-ui-default
