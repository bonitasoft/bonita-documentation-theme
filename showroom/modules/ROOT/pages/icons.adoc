:page-editable: true

Antora support the use of a rich icon set (here thanks to font-awesome project). Your can find all the details here : https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/icon-macro/

You can explore the free icons here : https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free

== Anatomy

The icon macro is an inline macro. Like other inline macros, its syntax follows the familiar pattern of the macro name and target separated by a colon followed by an attribute list enclosed in square brackets.

[source, asciidoc]
----
icon:<target>[<attrlist>]
----

The <target> is the icon name or path. The <attrlist> specifies various named attributes to configure how the icon is displayed.

== Example

The following snippet :

[source, asciidoc]
----
icon:face-grin-tongue-squint[2x,role=blue] icon:beer[5x,role=green]
----

should render as :  icon:face-grin-tongue-squint[2x,role=blue] icon:beer[5x,role=green]
