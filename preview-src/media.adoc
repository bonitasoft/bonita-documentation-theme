=== Embed videos

It is possible to embed videos as it is done in Bonita 2021.1 index page: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/audio-and-video/

* A default/max size is set for the mobile view
* there is no default for the desktop view at the moment, so you should set the dimensions when declaring the `video` macro
as in the following example

// this fake block is here to add a break line before the video
{empty} +

video::Hl1thnPla7E[youtube, width=640,height=380]
